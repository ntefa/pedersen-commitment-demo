# go-pedersen-commitment
Go version of the Pedersen commitment scheme.

This is a pure Go implementation of the Pedersen Commitment Scheme.
It makes use of Bas Westerbaan's https://github.com/bwesterb/go-ristretto to create commitments.
Pederson Commitments are used for Confidential Transactions. It uses Cryptography and Elliptic Curves to do that.
